\chapter{High Eccentricity Population}

\section{Introduction} \label{intro}


It is now well established that accretion of lower mass systems
is a fundamental component of the evolution and mass build up of
galaxies \citep{1991ApJ...379...52W}.  Due to its very long dynamical
timescale, the stellar halo of the Milky Way keeps a record of the
Galaxy's past accretion activity.  That record can be accessed
through the collection of precision 6D phase space and multi-element abundance
information for very large samples of halo stars, which together enable fundamental
tests of galaxy formation models.  While this field has a long history \citep[e.g.,][]{1962ApJ...136..748E,1978ApJ...225..357S},
we highlight only a few of the main contributions from the past
decade, for brevity.  \citet{2010A&A...511L..10N} and
\citet{2012A&A...538A..21S} were the first to identify the presence
of an older, high~$\alpha$ and a younger, low~$\alpha$ halo population at metallicity lower than that of the Galactic disc in the solar neighbourhood,
whose kinematics suggested an {\it in situ} and an accreted nature,
respectively.  More recently, \citet{2015MNRAS.453..758H} proposed
abundance ratio diagnostics to distinguish accreted from {\it in
situ} halo stars, arguing that the accreted population dominates
the nearby halo. Using APOGEE data, \citet{2018ApJ...852...50F} and
\citet{2018ApJ...852...49H} studied the chemical compositions and
kinematics of the metal-rich nearby halo, suggesting that much of
the low \mgfe{} halo population is associated with the debris of accreted satellites, likely with a similar star formation history to
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

Studies of the Galactic halo are being revolutionised by the advent of large astrometric,
photometric, and spectroscopic surveys of the stellar populations
of the Galaxy.  The \emph{Gaia} astrometric satellite has opened
new avenues for exploration of substructure in phase space, with
the potential for new discoveries further amplified by the addition
of chemical information from spectroscopic surveys.  Indeed, combining
\emph{Gaia} parallaxes and proper motions
\citep{2016arXiv160904303L,2018arXiv180409365G} with spectroscopic
data from SDSS \citep{2000AJ....120.1579Y} and APOGEE
\citep{2015arXiv150905420M}, two groups have identified what seems
to be the accretion of a relatively massive stellar system that
dominates the stellar populations of the nearby halo.  Analysing a
sample of SDSS-\emph{Gaia} DR1 main sequence stars,
\citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B} showed that the velocity ellipsoid of
halo stars becomes strongly anisotropic for stars with [Fe/H]$>$--1.7.
Comparing their data to a suite of N-body only cosmological numerical
simulations, they concluded that such orbital configurations are
likely to result from the accretion of a massive satellite at about
the time of the formation of the Galactic disc, roughly between
$z=1$ and 3.

Based on \emph{Gaia} DR2 data, \citet{2018arXiv180500453M} determined the configuration
of MW globular clusters (GCs) in action space.  They find that 12 GCs in the halo
are consistent with an origin in a single massive accretion event, consistent with the conclusions reached by
\citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B}.  \citet{2018arXiv180500453M} find that these clusters have
highly eccentric orbits, at $e \gtrsim 0.85$, and suggest that the fact that all the
clusters occupy a similar region in action space supports the idea
that this highly anisotropic stellar population in the halo is mainly
formed from the debris of a single accretion event.

In a follow up study, \citet{2018arXiv180510288D} estimated the
orbital parameters for a sample of nearby main-sequence and distant
horizontal-branch stars by combining \emph{Gaia} DR2 data
\citep{2018arXiv180409365G} with spectroscopic outputs from SDSS-DR9
\citep{2012ApJS..203...21A}.  They found that the apocentre radii
of a significant population of stars in the halo appear to `pile
up' at an $r_\mathrm{ap} \sim 20$ kpc. The authors link this
population with that found by \citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B}, which
they nickname the ``sausage'', due to the shape of the distribution
in velocity space.  This result has special significance in light
of the analysis of numerical simulations by \citet{2013ApJ...763..113D},
who proposed that the existence of a ``break radius'' in the Milky
Way halo, beyond which the stellar density drops precipitously, is
associated with the ``pile up'' of stellar apocenters at a comparable
Galactocentric distance.  \citet{2013ApJ...763..113D} argue that
the observed existence of a break radius in the Milky Way halo and
the absence of such a break in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) suggests
that the latter had a much more prolonged accretion history than
the former.

An independent analysis of \emph{Gaia} DR2 data conducted by
\citet{2018ApJ...860L..11K} identified the presence of a large,
old, and metal-poor slightly counter-rotating structure in phase
space (which they refer to as the ``blob'').  They concluded that
this population is associated with a relatively massive object
which, they hypothesised, may have been responsible for the heating
of the thick disc.  Following up on that result,
\citet{2018arXiv180606038H} used kinematic, chemical, and age
information for a large sample of stars in \emph{Gaia} and APOGEE
to identify a population of metal-poor stars with the same phase
space characteristics as the ``blob''.  The distribution of this
stellar population in the \afe{}-\feh{} plane, with relatively low
\afe{} and a large spread in \feh{}, suggests the chemical evolution
trend of a relatively massive system \citep[the recent preprint posting of][hints at a similar conclusion, also on the basis of APOGEE data]{2018arXiv180707269F}.  Moreover, the positions of
the stars in the HR diagram are consistent with old ages (10-13
Gyr).  According to  \citet{2018arXiv180606038H}, the accretion of
a dwarf galaxy with an approximate mass of the Small Magellanic
Cloud \citep[necessary to explain the chemistry of this accreted
population,][]{2018ApJ...852...49H} $\sim 10$ Gyr ago may have been
responsible for the heating of the thick disc. The notion that the
thick disc was formed from the vertical heating of a thinner
progenitor disc competes with the so-called 'upside-down' formation
scenario \citep[see, e.g][]{2013ApJ...773...43B,2017arXiv170901040N}
according to which the early gaseous disc was thick as a result of
strong stellar feedback, and slowly settled as the star formation
waned to form the thinner components of the disc.  Despite their
differences, both scenarios are consistent with at least some heating
of the stellar disc by satellite mergers, which in turn are also
likely necessary to explain the flaring of high \afe{} mono-age
disc populations \citep[e.g.][]{2015ApJ...804L...9M,2017arXiv170600018M}.
In general, recent observational results do not seem to point towards
a scenario where the thick disc formed thin and was heated entirely
by mergers, which would produce a plateau in the age or $\alpha$~abundance
against scale height relationship that is not currently borne out
by the data
\citep[e.g.][]{2012ApJ...751..131B,2012ApJ...753..148B,2012ApJ...755..115B,2016ApJ...823...30B,2016MNRAS.455..987C,2017arXiv170600018M}

In addition to, and in support of these findings,
\citet{2018MNRAS.tmp.1537K} recently inferred that the Milky Way
has had a rather atypical assembly history given its mass, based on analysis of 
the age-metallicity relation of Galactic GCs. They found that the
assembly rate of the Milky Way was among the uppermost quartile of
galaxies in their simulation, and identified three recent massive accretion events. According to those authors, two of the accretion events were proposed to correspond to the Sagittarius
dwarf and  Canis Major. The most
massive of the identified accretion events is suggested to have no
known debris, and have a stellar mass $> 10^9 \mathrm{M_\odot}$,
and correspond to GCs that reside close to the Galactic center. It
seems possible, given the evidence in the GC population, that the
accreted satellite identified by \citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B} and
\citet{2018ApJ...860L..11K} corresponds to the Canis Major debris
identified in that work, given that the `sausage' GCs identified
by \citet{2018arXiv180500453M} are further out in the halo, and the
Canis Major GCs were those at Galactocentric distances $> 10$ kpc.
The finding that the assembly history of the Milky Way is atypical
is also consistent with the work of \citet{2018MNRAS.477.5072M},
who found that Milky Way stellar mass galaxies in the EAGLE simulation
with \afe{} abundance patterns similar to the Milky Way had atypical
dark matter accretion histories, characterised by early, rapid
accretion, which slowed at late times.

In summary, the local stellar halo has been shown to be dominated
by a population of moderately metal-poor, low~\afe{}, old stars on
highly eccentric orbits.  This population is the likely remnant of
a major accretion event that took place at about the same time that
the Galactic disc was itself forming.  These results have important
implications, which prompted us to examine the chemical and kinematic
properties of the newly discovered stellar population in detail.
In this paper we present an analysis of the
 abundance pattern of stars in common between the \emph{Gaia}-DR2
and APOGEE-DR14 catalogs, and discuss the implications of their
kinematic properties in light of the  EAGLE suite of numerical
cosmological simulations. We extend the studies of the element abundances in these populations to include odd-$Z$ and Iron peak elements, and examine the detailed kinematics of stars in sub-populations defined by abundances and orbit eccentricity. We also extend previous theoretical work on this population by examining the kinematics of accreted debris from a fully self-consistent cosmological simulation that provides a cosmologicallly motivated sample of accreted satellite debris onto Milky Way mass haloes.  In Section \ref{data} we describe our
sample selection and orbital parameter determination, as well as
the details of the EAGLE simulations.  In Section \ref{highe} we
discuss the chemical and kinematic properties of this population.
In Section \ref{eagle} we contrast the kinematic properties of the
newly discovered stellar population with the expectations from
cosmological numerical simulations.  Our conclusions are summarised
in Section \ref{finale}.


\section{Sample and Data} \label{data}
\subsection{APOGEE DR14}

Our study is based on a cross-match between the SDSS-APOGEE DR14
and \emph{Gaia} DR2 catalogues. APOGEE \citep{2015arXiv150905420M}
is a near infrared spectroscopic survey of the stellar populations
of the Galaxy and its Local group neighbours. The data employed in this paper
come from the DR14 catalogue \citep{2018ApJS..235...42A}, which
comprises a re-reduction and analysis of APOGEE-1 data \citep[from
SDSS-III,][]{2011AJ....142...72E}, alongside a set of newly reduced
and analysed observations from APOGEE-2 \citep[taken as part of
SDSS-IV,][]{2017AJ....154...28B}.  APOGEE DR14 contains
high S/N, R$\sim$22,500 spectra, radial velocities, stellar photospheric
parameters, and element abundances for over 270,000 stars in the
$H$-band (1.5-1.7$\mathrm{\mu m}$).   Observations are carried out
using the 2.5m SDSS Telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO)
\citep{2006AJ....131.2332G}, and fibre-fed to the APOGEE spectrograph
\citep{2010SPIE.7735E..1CW}. Targeting is performed so as to simplify as much as possible the
survey selection function whilst preferentially selecting red giant
stars, by employing selection bins in the apparent $H$-band magnitude,
and a simple colour selection in dereddened $(J-K)_0$
\citep{2013AJ....146...81Z,2017AJ....154..198Z}. Spectra are reduced, combined and then
analysed through the APOGEE data reduction pipeline
\citep{2015AJ....150..173N}, and the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and
Chemical Abundances Pipeline \citep[ASPCAP,][]{2016AJ....151..144G}.
ASPCAP relies on a pre-computed library of synthetic stellar spectra
\citep{2015AJ....149..181Z} computed using a customised linelist
\citep{2015ApJS..221...24S} to measure stellar parameters, 19 element
abundances and heliocentric radial velocities of MW stars
\citep{2015AJ....150..148H}. Abundances are well tested against
samples from the literature \citep[][in press.]{jonssondr14}.
 We use distances
for stars in APOGEE DR14 measured by the Brazilian Participation
Group \citep[BPG,][]{2016A&A...585A..42S}, included in a publicly
available Value-Added Catalogue (VAC). These distances are measured
using an early version of the StarHorse code \citep{2018MNRAS.476.2556Q},
and combine spectroscopic and photometric information to make a
Bayesian distance estimation. The expected precision of these
measurements is expected to be $\sim 15 \%$, which we determine to
be similar to distance estimates derived from the current \emph{Gaia}
parallaxes at the range of distances spanned by our sample of
interest.  Given that the parallax measurements can be uncertain
in some cases, and especially so for distant stars, we believe the use of spectro-photometric distances to be well motivated.

We examined the distribution of our sample stars in chemical
composition space considering all elemental abundances available
in the APOGEE DR14 catalog.  However, in this paper we choose to focus on
the abundances of Fe, Mg, Al, and Ni, which are the ones providing
interesting insights into the nature of the accreted halo stellar
population. The elemental abundances are measured as part of the
ASPCAP pipeline, which uses a two-step process. First, the stellar
parameters $T_{\mathrm{eff}}, \log(g), v_\mu, \mathrm{[M/H]},
\mathrm{[\alpha/M]}, \mathrm{[C/M]},$ and $\mathrm{[N/M]}$ (where $v_\mu$ is the micro-turbulent velocity) are
determined via a global fit to the aforementioned spectral library
\citep{2015AJ....149..181Z}. The individual element abundances are then claculated by
adjusting the $\mathrm{[M/H]}$ ($\mathrm{[C/M]}$ and $\mathrm{[N/M]}$ for Carbon and Nitrogen, and $\mathrm{[\alpha/M]}$ for $\alpha$
elements) of the best-fit spectrum, and finding the best match to the
observed spectrum in windows around features in the spectrum which
are dominated by each element. The abundances are then all estimated consistently, and can then be calibrated internally relative
to open cluster observations. The internal calibrations are performed
to account for systematic abundance variations with $T_\mathrm{eff}$.
In DR14, an external calibration is applied that
forces the abundance ratios of solar metallicity stars located near the
solar circle to be equal to solar \citep[][in press]{holtzdr14}.
This small zero-point correction should be taken into consideration
when making comparisons between our results and other data.



\subsection{\emph{Gaia} DR2 and cross matching}

The ESA-\emph{Gaia} mission is a space-based astrometric survey
which is providing an unprecendented mapping of MW stars in
phase space. The second data-release, \emph{Gaia} DR2
\citep{2018arXiv180409365G}, provides 5-parameter astrometry (proper
motions, positions and parallaxes) for over 1.3 million objects in
the Galaxy.  Combined with accurate radial velocities and spectro-photometric distance estimates from
APOGEE DR14, these data make possible the calculation of 6D phase
space coordinates for each object.
Many improvements were made to the data-processing between \emph{Gaia}
DR1 \citep{2016arXiv160904303L} and DR2, examples of which include:
improvements to the source detection algorithm, better modelling
of the spacecraft attitude, and the fact that DR2 uses its own
reference frame based on quasars (whereas DR1 was tied to the
\emph{Tycho-2} and \textsc{Hipparcos} catalogues for proper motion
measurements). As a result of these improvements, the typical
uncertainty on astrometric parameters is expected to be $\sim 0.2$
to $0.3$ mas in the middle of the magnitude range (going up
to $\sim 2$ mas for the faintest sources). While the exact selection
function of \emph{Gaia} is as yet not well known, DR2 has improved
completeness in bright stars, and the survey is expected to be
complete between $G=12$ and 17.

We perform a cross-match between APOGEE DR14 and \emph{Gaia} DR2
using the CDS X-match
service\footnote{\url{http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/xmatch}} and
adopting a conservative position mismatch tolerance of 0.5$"$.  We
find that the raw APOGEE DR14 catalogue has 254,789 matched objects
in \emph{Gaia} DR2 ($\sim 99\%$), 83,189 of which have full 6D phase-space coordinates (using APOGEE radial velocities),
have no warning or bad flags from the APOGEE reduction and ASPCAP
analysis, and were not observed during commissioning of the APOGEE
instrument (the main factor that reduces the sample size are the APOGEE data quality flag cuts).  Of these objects, 81,491 have reliable distance
measurements in the APOGEE DR14 distance VAC.  We transform the
observed data into the Galactocentric coordinate frame, assuming
the solar motion of \citet{2010MNRAS.403.1829S}, propagating the
observational uncertainties while accounting for the correlation between
errors in the \emph{Gaia} data. The sample extends from Galactocentric cylindrical radii $R \sim
3$~kpc out to $ R > 15$~kpc, reaching up to a maximum of
$10$~kpc away from the midplane. Throughout the paper, we
assume the solar radius $R_0 = 8$~kpc, and its distance from the
midplane $z_0 = 0.025$~kpc.

Stars located within $r = 3\ r_{\mathrm{tidal}}$ of the centres of
known globular clusters were
excluded from the sample.  Tidal radii, $r_\mathrm{tidal}$, and
cluster centres were adopted from the 2010 edition of the
\citet{1996AJ....112.1487H}
catalog\footnote{\url{http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat}}.
This conservative cut removes 19 stars, after removal of stars not belonging to the main APOGEE sample
(e.g., stars from APOGEE ancillary science programs). 

\subsection{Orbital parameters}

To study the kinematical structure of the halo population
in the APOGEE-\emph{Gaia} catalogue, it is necessary to
estimate the orbital parameters of the stars and their associated
uncertainties robustly. To make these estimates, we use the fast orbit
parameter estimation method of \citet{2018arXiv180202592M}, which
adapts the St\"ackel fudge method for estimating action-angle
coordinates in axisymmetric potentials \citep[presented in][]{2012MNRAS.426.1324B}
to directly estimate the orbital eccentricity, $e$, apo-
and pericentre radii, $r_\mathrm{ap}$ and $r_\mathrm{peri}$, and the
maximum vertical excursion, $Z_\mathrm{max}$, to high precision and
without recourse to orbit integration (which can make the proper
propagation of uncertainties computationally costly at this scale).
We also estimate the orbital actions, $J_{R}, L_{Z},$ and $J_{Z}$
for each star via the same method. All estimates are performed
using the implementation of the St\"ackel approximation in the
python package \texttt{galpy} \citep{2015ApJS..216...29B}. For each
star, we Monte-Carlo (MC) sample the errors by constructing the
covariance matrix of the observed data. We sample 100 realisations
of the observed coordinates of each star, and compute the orbit
parameters and actions for each sampled point, cataloguing the
median value of the samples for each parameter, their standard
deviation, and the correlation between parameters.

\subsection{The EAGLE simulations}

In Section \ref{eagle} we undertake a simple analysis of
simulated galaxies from the EAGLE suite
\citep{2015MNRAS.446..521S,2015MNRAS.450.1937C}. EAGLE models the
formation and evolution of galaxies in the context of $\mathrm{\Lambda
CDM}$ cosmology. The simulations are run using a version of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and TreePM gravity solver
\textsc{Gadget 3} \citep[described most recently by
][]{2005MNRAS.364.1105S}, modified to include the
\citet{2013MNRAS.428.2840H} pressure-entropy formulation of SPH, a
time-step limiter \citep{2012MNRAS.419..465D}, and switches for
artificial viscosity and conduction \citep[as proposed
by][]{2010MNRAS.408..669C,2010MNRAS.401.1475P}. EAGLE produces a
realistic population of galaxies by virtue of the calibration of its feedback efficiency to
the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), the stellar vs. black hole mass relation and galaxy disc sixes, but has been shown to reproduce a broad range of observed galaxy properties and scaling
relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation \citep{2017MNRAS.464.4736F},
colour-magnitude relationships
\citep{2015MNRAS.452.2879T,2016MNRAS.460.3925T,2017MNRAS.470..771T}, and
galaxy size evolution \citep{2017MNRAS.465..722F}. All particle data and galaxy catalogues are now available publicly \citep[see][]{2016A&C....15...72M} and are accessible online\footnote{\url{http://galaxy-catalogue.dur.ac.uk}}.

The EAGLE suite offers various box sizes ranging from 12.5 to
100 cMpc on a side. Here, we only examine the higher resolution
simulation adopting the `Recalibrated' model parameters
\citep[see][]{2015MNRAS.446..521S}, referred to here as L025N752-Recal.
The motivation behind this decision is the better resolution of
small dwarf galaxies, and therefore better sampling of the accreted
galaxy population within the EAGLE haloes. L025N752-Recal has dark
matter particles of mass $1.21\times 10^{6}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
and an initially equal number of SPH particles with mass $2.26\times
10^{5}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, adopting a Plummer-equivalent gravitational
softening length $\epsilon_\mathrm{com}=1.33$ ckpc, limited to a
maximum proper length of $\epsilon_\mathrm{prop}=0.35$pkpc. We
select a sample of galaxies which have virial masses roughly equal
to that proposed for the Milky Way, between $M_{200} = $ 0.8 and 2.0 $ \times
10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In the L025N752-Recal
simulation, this corresponds to $N=22$ galaxies with a wide range of
stellar masses, and a range of assembly and accretion histories.
This sample makes a good testbed for understanding the origin of
satellite debris in the Milky Way, allowing us to study the $z=0$
characteristics of a diverse sample of satellite galaxies accreted
onto Milky-Way-like haloes.

To calculate the eccentricities for the simulated star particles,
we solve (using the bisection method) the equation
\begin{equation}
L^2 + 2 r^2 (\Phi(r) - E) = 0 ,
\end{equation}
where L is the angular momentum, $\Phi(r)$ the gravitational potential
and E the total energy of the particle. For a bound orbit the
equation has two solutions (the peri- and apocentre distances, $r_\mathrm{peri}$
and $r_\mathrm{ap}$), which are equal for a perfectly circular orbit \citep[][eq.
3.14]{2008gady.book.....B}. Unbound particles are disregarded.  The
eccentricity is then calculated as
\begin{equation}
e = \frac{(r_\mathrm{ap}-r_\mathrm{peri}) }{(r_\mathrm{ap}+r_\mathrm{peri}) }.
\end{equation}



\section{The high eccentricity halo population} \label{highe}

As mentioned above, \citet{2018arXiv180606038H} used APOGEE-DR14
abundances to show that a stellar population they initially identified
in phase space occupies a distinct locus in the \afe{}-\feh{} plane.
Among all $\alpha$ elements available from APOGEE spectra, 
Mg is the one for which abundances are the most reliable in the
metal-poor regime, due to the number of available lines and their
strength at low metallicity.  Therefore we decide to first look at
how stellar populations are distributed in the Mg-Fe plane as a
function of orbital eccentricity.  We show the \mgfe{}-\feh{}
distribution of APOGEE DR14 in Figure \ref{fig:characterisation},
where the greyscale is such that stars with higher orbital eccentricity
$e$ are represented by darker symbols.

Three main groups of stars are apparent in \mgfe{}-\feh{} space,
which we indicate using solid and dashed black lines (the dotted
gray line indicates the upper limit imposed on \feh{} for the
analysis in Section \ref{sec:abundances}).  The focus of this paper
is on the group we call the \textit{accreted halo}, which occupies
the same locus as the stellar population identified by other groups
as associated to a major accretion event (see Section \ref{intro}).
It also corresponds to the ``LMg'' population identified by
\citet{2018ApJ...852...49H} and\citet{2018ApJ...852...50F} on the
basis of APOGEE DR13 chemistry and kinematics.  It extends between
(\feh{}, \mgfe{}) $\sim(-2.0, 0.3)$ to $\sim (-0.5, -0.1)$ and is
dominated by high eccentricity stars.  The other groups are the
well known high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ {\it disc} populations,
characterised in detail in several previous studies
\citep[e.g.][]{2014ApJ...796...38N,2015ApJ...808..132H,2015MNRAS.453.1855M,2017arXiv170600018M},
and commonly conflated with the thick and thin discs, respectively.
As expected, the latter populations are dominated by stars in very
circular orbits, although the high-$\alpha$ group contains a
non-negligible population of stars in fairly eccentric orbits (e.g
$> 0.7$)---a topic that will be explored in a future study.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{characterisation.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:characterisation} The \mgfe{}-\feh{} plane in
APOGEE DR14, coloured by orbital eccentricity $e$, as estimated
using the method of \citet{2018arXiv180202592M}. The points are
plotted with the highest $e$ stars overlaying the points at lower
$e$, such that the highest $e$ populations stand out. It is clear
that a population extends from (\feh{},\mgfe{}) $\sim$  (-2.0, 0.3)
to $\sim$ (-1.0, 0.1) that appears to consist mainly of stars on
highly eccentric orbits, with a distinct element abundance pattern
to that of the Galactic disc (at \feh{}$>-0.7$). The dotted gray
line reflects the cut in \feh{} which is imposed to perform the
$k$-means analysis.}
\end{figure*}

Careful inspection of the `accreted halo' stars in
Figure~\ref{fig:characterisation} suggests that there is some
dependence of \mgfe{} on eccentricity, in that stars with higher
$e$ have slightly lower \mgfe{}.  Further examination of the data
suggests that the same was the case for \alfe{} and possibly \nife{}
and to a lesser extent [(C+N)/Fe].  
 This finding motivates us to attempt an identification
of sub-structure in chemo-kinematic space in an objective and
data-driven fashion, so as to avoid ``cherry-picking'' arbitrary
selection limits in various parameters.  In this way we hope to
characterise the populations in the accreted halo regime by
sub-dividing its member stars into meaningful groups.  We use the
\texttt{scikit-learn} $k$-means clustering algorithm \citep{scikit-learn}
in the space of \feh{}, \mgfe{}, \alfe{}, \nife{} and eccentricity
$e$.  The choice of these parameters is guided by the fact that,
on one hand, these elements fall into the main groups: $\alpha$,
odd-z and Fe peak elements, respectively, and on the other hand it
appears, at least from Figure \ref{fig:characterisation}, that
eccentricity is a useful discriminator between disc and accreted
halo populations.  We limit the maximum \feh{} to --0.7, to minimise
contamination by disc stars, finding that high $e$ stars in the low \afe{} disc locus at higher \feh{} are not chemically similar to those in the 'accreted halo' population and can be confidently disregarded. We set the assumed number of clusters,
$k= 4$, to anticipate the expected separation of the high and low \afe{} disc, and then
to allow for subdivision of the accreted halo population into any potentially meaningful
groups.  We find that the algorithm groups the high and low \afe{}
disc stars separately, and finds two clear groups in the lower
\feh{} space.  Setting $k>4$ subdivides the lower \feh{} groups in
an unstable manner, while $k=4$ provides very good stability over
many iterations of the algorithm. We also test the algorithm at $k
< 4$, finding that the stability is decreased also at lower $k$.
If the `accreted' halo group from Figure \ref{fig:characterisation}
is isolated, using $k=2$ clustering can still recover the two groups
found when clustering the whole data set. We retain the full data-set
and use the $k=4$ clustering to avoid resorting to an arbitrary
selection of the division between halo and disc stars. Re-scaling
the data and re-running the clustering provides little difference to
the results. It is worth noticing that both accreted halo
populations have lower abundance ratios than thick disc stars (in
the region where they overlap in [Fe/H]) for C+N, Si, K, Ca, Ti,
and possibly also Mn.


We show the eccentricity distributions of the $k$-means groups in
Figure \ref{fig:eccdist}. The high and low~\afe{} disc groups are
combined into a single group here, as these stars are not of interest
to this work, except as a comparison sample. The halo stars are
separated into one group with intermediate eccentricities, peaking
at $e \sim 0.5$, and a group with very high eccentricity, peaking
at $e \sim 0.9$. The lower $e$ population distribution is
fairly broad whereas the high~$e$ population is very strongly
peaked toward the highest $e$ values (with some small skew to low
$e$). The high and low~$e$ groups contain 679 and 318 stars,
respectively. We also show the $k$-means groups in \alfe{}-\mgfe{}
space in Figure \ref{fig:mgal}.  This abundance plane was shown by
\citet{2015MNRAS.453..758H} to discriminate well between accreted
and in-situ stellar populations in the Milky Way, with the former
occupying the low \alfe{}, low \mgfe{} region of the plot.
Indeed, we find that the accreted halo population separates out from the disc
population very clearly in this plane, being characterised by lower
Al and Mg abundances.  Moreover, while there is considerable overlap
between high and low~$e$ populations in this abundance plane, the
high~$e$ group occupies a lower \mgfe{} locus, on average, in this
plane compared to the low~$e$ group.

\alfe{}. Discdisc stars (in black) are enhanced in Al and, to a lesser
extent, Mg, relative to the high and low~$e$ groups.}

In conclusion, the results above show that once APOGEE chemical
compositions are combined with kinematics inferred from Gaia DR2
distances and proper motions, $\sim 2/3$ of the stars in the accreted
halo population identified in previous studies are characterised
by highly eccentric orbits.  In the following sub-sections we examine
the properties of this population in both orbital and element
abundance space compared to those of their low~$e$ counterparts.



\subsection{Chemical Compositions}

\subsubsection{Metallicity Distributions} \label{sec:mdfs}

In this Section we examine more closely the chemical compositions
of the accreted halo populations, keeping track of the differences
between the the high and low~$e$ groups.  We start by examining the
metallicity distribution function (MDF) of these populations.  The
{\it raw} MDFs are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:mdfs}, and are {\it
not} corrected for the APOGEE selection function. Correction for
selection function effects can not be performed to the full sample of stars studied here,
as many of the sample stars belong to magnitude bins on plates where observations were
incomplete in DR14 and so are not part of the statistical sample
\citep[see][for details on the selection function of APOGEE and the
targeting strategy, respectively]{2014ApJ...790..127B,2013AJ....146...81Z}.
For this reason, the corrected MDF of stars in DR14 which could be corrected for is plagued by noise due
to low number statistics, particularly in the case of the (smaller)
low~$e$ population sample.  We nevertheless compared the lower $N$, corrected
and raw MDFs for the larger high~$e$ sample, which is statistically
more robust, finding them to be in good overall agreement with
similar peak position and width.  Therefore, we can confidently
compare the MDF of the high~$e$ population with those of others
systems, at least to first order.  In addition, it is safe to assume
that relative differences between the MDFs of the high and low~$e$
populations are not affected significantly by selection biases from
the targeting strategy, and that any differences in the MDFs are
likely to be real.

With the above caveats in mind, examining Figure \ref{fig:mdfs} we
learn that the MDF of the high-$e$ population peaks at \feh{}$\sim$--1.3
and has a width of approximately 0.6 dex (FWHM), with a tail towards
the metal-poor end, resembling the MDF of a classical closed-box model.  Its MDF is in fact qualitatively similar to
those of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group
\citep[e.g.][]{2015AJ....149..198R}, and in particular quite similar
to those of the Small Magellanic Cloud \citep[SMC,][]{2014MNRAS.442.1680D}
and Leo I \citep{2013ApJ...779..102K}. This is an interesting
result given that \citet{2018ApJ...852...49H}  showed that their LMg
population (of which the high-$e$ stars are a sub-group) had a star
formation history similar to that of massive dwarfs like the LMC
prior to its accretion, which would have likely been around present day
SMC mass \citep[$\sim 3\times 10^{8} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$,
e.g.][]{2004ApJ...604..176S,2018MNRAS.478.5017R} at the time that the LMg population was accreted
\citep{2009IAUS..256...81V,2018arXiv180606038H}.

It is also instructive to compare the MDFs of the high and low~$e$
populations.  The most striking difference is that the MDF of the
low~$e$ population has no strong peak, but rather two smaller (likely
significant) peaks at lower metallicities.  The sharp edge at
\feh{}=--0.7 is due to the \feh{} limit adopted in our $k$-means
grouping, and the smaller peak of the low~$e$ population at
\feh{}$>$--1.0 is probably due to disc contamination.  Interestingly,
the two peaks towards the lower metallicity end happen at similar
metalicities to those previously assigned to the inner and outer
halo populations \citep[e.g.][]{2007Natur.450.1020C,2014A&A...568A...7A,2015A&A...577A..81F}.  Most
importantly, the MDFs of the high and low~$e$ populations are
strikingly different, and this difference is almost certainly
insensitive to selection effects, which then strongly suggests that
the two populations have different origins.

It is not entirely clear how the difference in shape between the
MDFs of the high and low~$e$ populations can be understood in terms
of the halo accretion history.  While the MDF of the high~$e$
population lends support to the notion that those stars were injected
into the halo as part of one major accretion event, it is
hard to draw any strong conclusion regarding the low~$e$ population.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{MDFhist_kmeansselect.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:mdfs} The raw metallicity distribution functions of the
high and low~$e$ populations.  Unlike their low~$e$ counterparts, the high 
$e$ population shows a strong peak at about \feh{}$\sim -1.3$, resembling
MDFs of Local Group dwarfs. The low~$e$ group shows peaks at both \feh{} $\sim -2.1$ and $\sim -1.4$, and stars piled up at the imposed upper \feh{} limit at \feh{} $= -0.7$.
}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Abundance Ratios}
\label{sec:abundances}
 In this section we inspect abundance ratios of the high and
low~$e$ groups, to gain further insights into the origins of these
two populations.  Figure \ref{fig:mgalni} displays the run of
[Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] as a function of \feh{}.  For each
element we take the running median and interquartile range of
$\mathrm{[X/Fe]}$ as a function of \feh{}. We calculate
the median abundance in bins of 50 stars sorted by increasing \feh{},
which is shown by the red and blue coloured bands for the high and
low~$e$ populations, respectively.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{mgalni_kmeansselect.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:mgalni} The Magnesium, Aluminium and Nickel
abundances of the $k$-means groups. These elements are good representations of $\alpha$, odd-$Z$ and
Fe peak elements that are measured by APOGEE. The coloured bands
show the interquartile range in bins of 50 stars
sorted in increasing \feh{}. The high and low~$e$ populations
are characterised by lower Mg and Al than the high-$\alpha$ stars.
The bottom panel shows that the high~$e$ group has slightly lower
[Ni/Fe] than the high-$\alpha$ population, whereas the low~$e$ group
is essentially consistent with the high-$\alpha$ population in
[Ni/Fe]. In all cases, the high~$e$ group median
is slightly lower than the low~$e$ group at fixed \feh{}. The
slightly higher \feh{} of the high~$e$ population is also evident
here.  Again, both groups are depleted in all these elements relative
to the discdisc stars at that \feh{}.}
\end{figure}

The top panel shows that in general, \mgfe{} decreases with \feh{},
and both the high and low~$e$ populations have \mgfe{} lower than
that of the high-$\alpha$ disc stars at same \feh{}, in the metallicity
interval where the two populations overlap
($\mathrm{-1.5\simless[Fe/H]\simless-0.5}$), as previously discussed
by \cite{2018ApJ...852...49H} and \citet{2018ApJ...852...50F}.
Moreover, the high and low~$e$ populations occupy slightly separated
sequences, such that the former has lower \mgfe{} at fixed \feh{}.
It appears from the simple running median that the high~$e$ population
exhibits a change in slope of \mgfe{} against \feh{}, at \feh{}$\sim-1.3$,
whilst there is only slight evidence change of slope in the lower
edge of the low~$e$ relation.  In order to test this further, and
to determine more rigorously the location of the change in slope,
we use a Bayesian inference to determine a generative model for the
\mgfe{}-\feh{} distribution of both populations. The full procedure
is outlined in Appendix \ref{sec:appA}, the basic principle being
that we fit a piecewise-linear model to the data of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pwlin}
\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}(\mathrm{[Fe/H]}) =
  \begin{cases}
    m_{1}\mathrm{[Fe/H]} + b_1  &  \quad \mathrm{[Fe/H]} < \mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0\\
    m_{2}\mathrm{[Fe/H]} + b_2  &  \quad \mathrm{[Fe/H]} > \mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $m_{[1,2]}$ and $b_{[1,2]}$ are the slope and
$y$-intercept either side of the break, which is positioned at
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=\mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0$. The fitting procedure accounts
for the error on both \mgfe{} and \feh{}, allowing a proper assessment
of the significance of any fitted breaks. If there is no break in
the range of \mgfe{} and \feh{} considered, the data are fit by a
simple linear relation, as the break is pushed to the edge of the
\feh{} range.

We show the models fitted to the high and low~$e$ groups in Figure
\ref{fig:mgknee}. The data for each group are plotted in the black
points, and the best fit and 95$\%$ confidence interval are shown
by the line and coloured bands in each panel. The high~$e$ group
model, shown in the top panel, has a change of slope found at high
significance, indicated by the dashed crosshair, positioned at
\feh{}$=-1.31^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ and \mgfe{}$=0.22^{+0.01}_{-0.08}$.
The  slope to the metal-poor side of the break is found to
be $-0.15\pm{0.01}$, and is roughly consistent with the slope before
the break in the high \mgfe{} disc star sequence \citep[e.g. that
seen in][]{2015ApJ...808..132H}. A similar metal-poor end slope 
is also present in the work of \citet{2018ApJ...852...50F},
who used APOGEE DR12 data to determine also that a change of slope
is present in low \mgfe{} stars, located at \feh{}$\sim-1.0$ dex,
in rough agreement with that found here.  At \feh{}$>\mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0$,
the slope steepens to become $-0.26\pm{0.01}$. The low~$e$ population
is well fit in this range of \feh{} by a simple linear relation
with a slope equal to $-0.14\pm{0.01}$, with no significant break
found. As it is likely that at least some of the stars at the highest
\feh{}, and at high \mgfe{} in this population are high \afe{} disc
contaminants, we also perform the same fit using stars at \feh{}~$<-1.$
dex, and still find no evidence of a break at the same position as
that found in the high~$e$ group. Fitting only low~$e$ stars with
\feh{}~$>-1.1$ dex, we find that the best fit is a single linear
relation with a slope equal to that found when using the whole
low~$e$ group.

\caption{\label{fig:mgknee} The best fit models for \mgfe{} as a

the banded blue and red regions either side of this line (the fit
for the other group is shown in each panel for reference). The raw
data are shown by the black scatter points. The high~$e$ group is
well-fit by a model with a break at \feh{}$=-1.31^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$
and \mgfe{}$=0.22^{+0.01}_{-0.08}$, as indicated by the dashed
crosshair. The low~$e$ group is better fit by a single linear
relation in the same range of \feh{}. The position of the models
also demonstrates the slightly higher \mgfe{} of the low~$e$ group.}

\end{figure*}


This change of slope in the \mgfe{}-\feh{} relation of the
high~$e$ population offers important clues on the nature of this
stellar population.  It is most straightforwardly interpreted as
being due to the onset of Fe enrichment by SNe Ia.  The \feh{} at
which the change of slope occurs is primarily related to the star
formation efficiency \citep[e.g.][]{2017ApJ...837..183W}, and
additionally depends on the gas inflow and outflow rates of its
parent galaxy. It follows that it should also be a function of the
mass of the parent galaxy,
which regulates gas density and gas inflow/outflow.  Data for stellar
samples from Local Group dwarf galaxies indicate the presence of
this same change of slope on the Mg-Fe plane, and it is suggested
that the \feh{} at which it occurs is higher in galaxies with larger
luminosity, and presumably higher stellar mass
\citep[see,e.g.][]{2009ARA&A..47..371T}.  Given the \feh{} at which
data for Local Group dwarf galaxies show a change of slope
\citep[see,e.g.][]{2009ARA&A..47..371T}, we estimate that the mass
of the progenitor of this high~$e$ population was somewhere between
$10^{8}$ and $10^{9} M_\odot$. This rough mass estimate is in good
agreement with that inferred from arguments based on the MDF of the
high~$e$ population in Section~\ref{sec:mdfs}.  It moreover places
the mass involved in this accretion event in the range of the total
stellar mass of the Galactic halo \citep[$\sim 4 - 7 \times 10^8\
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$] {2016ARA&A..54..529B} which argues against the
high~$e$ population belonging to more than one major accretion
event, as multiple accretions at this mass would exceed this mass
limit. 

In contrast, the lack of a clear change of slope in the
 distribution of the low~$e$ stars on the Mg-Fe plane, argues
strongly for this group being in fact some mix of stellar
populations with various origins, including stars accreted in
different smaller events, stars formed \emph{in situ}, ejected members
of the disc, remanent contamination from the high~$e$ group.

The middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig:mgalni} shows the run of \alfe{}
with \feh{}.  As pointed out by \citet{2018ApJ...852...49H}, the
accreted populations are characterised by much lower \alfe{} than
the disc populations at same \feh{}.  In fact, \alfe{} in this
system is comparable to that of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal \citep{2017ApJ...845..162H}.  Also very interestingly,
the high and low~$e$ populations occupy separate tracks in
\alfe{}-\feh{} space, with the high $e$ population showing lower
\alfe{}.  For both populations \alfe{} increases with \feh{}. As
an odd-$Z$ element, Al is an important component in the explosive
ejecta of massive stars, synthesised in their carbon and nitrogen
burning phases. It is also a product of Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stellar nucleosynthesis, particularly at \feh{}$> -0.2$ dex
\citep[see, e.g.][]{2016arXiv160408613A}. Importantly, it is known
that even explosive odd-$Z$ element yields should be metallicity
dependent to some extent due to their dependence on a high neutron
surplus \citep[e.g.][]{1996snih.book.....A}. This fact may explain
the slight correlation observed between \alfe{} and \feh{} in each
group and also in the disc populations.  The depletion in \alfe{}
relative to the MW disc in both groups is likely due to the fact
that the MW has seen more metallicity dependent yield of Al, and
an increased contribution to the ISM from AGB stars.

While the trend in Ni abundances as a function of \feh{} of the
high~$e$ group appears to be roughly similar to that of the low~$e$
group, it is noteworthy that the trend is negative in both groups,
such that \nife{} decreases with increasing \feh{}.  Similarly to
the other elements, Ni is slightly depleted in the high~$e$ group
relative to the low~$e$ group, but this depletion is very small.
At fixed \feh{}, the high~$e$ group has a lower \nife{} than the
disc stars, whereas the low~$e$ group is nearly consistent
with them. 

We also studied the other $\alpha$, odd-$Z$ and Fe peak elements
available in APOGEE. These trends appear to be consistent between
most of the elements. It is noteworthy that in almost all elements,
the low~$e$ group appears to show slightly higher abundance ratios
than the high~$e$ group, at fixed \feh{}, which may be difficult
to explain by invoking lower mass accretion events, unless the star
formation in these stellar populations was very short and intense.
Our discussion of the EAGLE simulations in Section \ref{eagle} sheds
some light on this matter.  


\subsection{Kinematics}

Figure \ref{fig:kinematics} shows the distribution of the $k$-means
groups in (from left to right) azimuthal angular-momentum $L_z$
(equivalent to the azimuthal action $J_\phi$), the maximum vertical
excursion of orbits above the midplane $z_\mathrm{max}$, and the
apocentric radius $r_\mathrm{ap}$, which is the maximum orbital
distance from the Galactic centre. The median value of each
distribution is shown by the coloured vertical dashed line. 

It is clear from this plot that the accreted halo groups (again,
shown in red and blue) have a very different orbit distribution
than the disc stars (in black).  The latter are characterised by
highly prograde orbits with relatively low vertical excursions.  In
turn, the two accreted halo populations differ substantially,
particularly in terms of their $L_z$ distributions. The high~$e$
stars all have extremely low angular momentum, such that many of
the stars in this population have negative $L_z$. The lower $e$
population has a large spread in $L_z$, such that many stars are
on prograde orbits while others have negative $L_z$, thus moving
on retrograde orbits. The lack of a distinct single peak in $L_z$
space for the low~$e$ group may indicate again that this group is
in fact a superposition of populations with different origins,
including the debris of smaller mass accreted satellites, whereas
the single, clear peak in $L_z$ for the high~$e$ group supports the
notion that this population is mainly the debris of a single
satellite. The median value of $L_z$ for the high~$e$ stars is $-176
\mathrm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ kpc}$.  A slightly retrograde motion for stars
in the halo at roughly these eccentricities was noted by
\citet{2018arXiv180606038H} and, as they suggest, could be either
an effect of the assumption of the solar motion (which is likely
subject to some systematic uncertainties), or could be a true feature
of this population, and further supports its origin in a single
accreted satellite. We find that a slight retrograde motion of the
high~$e$ stars is present when assuming either the
\citet{2010MNRAS.403.1829S} or \citet{2005ApJ...629..268H} solar
motion measurements, which differ markedly.

The $z_\mathrm{max}$ distribution shows that the stars belonging
to the high and low~$e$ populations are on orbits that take them
very far above the midplane of the Galaxy, extending to $z_\mathrm{max}>10$
kpc, as expected for halo stars. The median $z_\mathrm{max}$ of the
high~$e$ population is higher than the other two populations, at
8.8 kpc. Similarly, the apocentre radii of these stars extend to
very large distances from the Galactic centre with a median
$r_\mathrm{ap} = 15.1$ kpc.  There appears to be a secondary peak
in the distribution at $r_\mathrm{ap} >\sim25$ kpc, which is roughly
consistent with the ``apocenter pile up'' suggested by
\citet{2018arXiv180510288D}.  Considering that the majority of the
stars in the accreted halo population are on highly eccentric orbits
($e > 0.9$) which are strongly out of the disc plane ($z_\mathrm{max}
> 10$ kpc), and have a median apocentre radius which is comparable
to that of the accreted halo population analysed by
\citet{2018arXiv180510288D}, it seems reasonable to conclude that
the high~$e$ stars are part of that population.

Further insights into the nature of the high and low~$e$ stellar
populations can be gained by inspection of Figure \ref{fig:polar},
where they are displayed together with disc populations on three
cylindric coordinate velocity planes.  The left panel shows
the $v_R-v_\phi$ plane, where the high $e$ population has a wide
spread in $v_R$ and a much narrower distribution in $v_\phi$.  This
is the same locus as that of the population identified by \citet[][their
Figure 2]{2018MNRAS.478..611B}.  The low $e$ group, on the other
hand, has a clearly bimodal distribution, with two concentrations
above and below the high $e$ population.  The concentration at
higher $v_\phi$ shows {\it prograde} rotation, overlapping well
with the disc population.  The grouping at lower $v_\phi$ is markedly
{\it retrograde}.  These two sub-populations are also clearly seen
on the right panel, where one can notice that their distributions
in $v_z$ are very similar.  The presence of such obvious structure
in velocity space calls for a closer scrutiny of those two
sub-populations in chemical composition space.

We compared the low~$e$ prograde and retrograde populations in MDF,
Mg-Fe, Al-Fe, and Ni-Fe spaces and found them to be, on one hand,
indistinguishable from each other but, on the other hand, clearly
distinct from the high~$e$ population in all diagnostic plots.  It
is likely that there is some degree of inter-contamination between
all these groups, so that the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:polar}
suggests strongly that the prograde population can be contributed
entirely or in part by the disc.  This is also suggested by the
presence of a secondary peak at the high \feh{} end of the low $e$
MDF (see Figure \ref{fig:mdfs}) which is dominated by prograde
stars.  However, quite puzzlingly, the prograde population is
chemically indistinguishable from its retrograde counterpart, which
is unlikely to be contributed by the disc.  We test this further
by re-fitting the relation between \mgfe{} and \feh{} for the
separated prograde and retrograde components, using the procedure
described in Appendix \ref{sec:appA}. We find that in both cases,
the best fit relation matches that found for the combined population
within the uncertainties, and furthermore, find no evidence of a
change in slope in either population.  Without further diagnostics
with which to make a call on the nature of the distinct low $e$
populations, we summarise the situation by concluding that it is
likely to be a mix of stars contributed by the accretion of the
high~$e$ population, smaller accretion events, puffed up disc, and
stars formed {\it in situ}.

\caption{\label{fig:polar} Distribution of disc and accreted halo

panel, the high $e$ population occupies the same locus in $v_R-v_\phi$
space (left panel) as the population identified by
\citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B}.  The low $e$ population splits into
two populations according to $v_\phi$, with one prograde and one
retrograde component, suggesting that this population may in fact
be from a mix of disc contaminants and debris from smaller satellites.

\section{Accreted Stellar Populations in EAGLE} \label{eagle}

the highest and lowest $e$, whereas early mergers tend to occupy
intermediate $e$. The most massive mergers also occur later, with
early mergers dominated by low mass haloes.}
\end{figure}

We have shown that the accreted stellar halo components observed
by APOGEE \citep[characterised by][]{2018ApJ...852...49H} have MDFs
and abundance patterns that are similar to those of dwarf galaxies
in the Local Group, which we divide into groups in terms of chemistry
and kinematics \citep[see also][]{2018ApJ...852...49H}. One
of these groups is characterised by highly eccentric and slightly
retrograde orbits, thus sharing similar properties with stellar
populations ascribed to a major accretion event in the distant past.
In this Section we examine predictions by numerical simulations,
drawing parallels with the observations to gain insights into the
nature of these accreted halo populations.  The questions we intend
to address with this exercise are the following: is the high~$e$
population the result of a single relatively massive accretion
event, as claimed by other groups?  Do the simulations provide
insight into the nature of the low~$e$ population? Is it composed
of a collection of small accretion events, or is it predominantly
formed {\it in situ}?

The EAGLE simulations are a useful  tool to address these
questions, as they provide a  cosmologically motivated history of
satellite accretion for Milky Way-like galaxies, simulated
self-consistently in a cosmological context.  Therefore,  we
expect the  $z=0$ dynamical state of accreted systems around Milky Way analogues in the simulations to
be a good approximation to the observations in the Milky Way halo.

To address the above questions, we track star particles formed in
galaxies which merged onto disc galaxies that eventually reach a
virial mass roughly equal to that of the Milky Way ($\sim 10^{12}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). At $z=0$, we measure the orbital eccentricity
$e$ of the star particles resulting from all well-resolved (in this case having $>20$ star particles) accretion
events of stellar systems with stellar mass $M_*$, occuring at
redshift $z_\mathrm{merge}$.  The individual eccentricity distributions
of accreted debris compare well to the distributions we find in the
Milky Way halo groups in terms of shape and their being unimodal. In Figure
\ref{fig:eagle}, we show the median $e$ of these distributions
against $z_\mathrm{merge}$ for accreted satellites onto the 22 Milky
Way virial mass ($\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) galaxies in the
EAGLE L025N752-Recal simulation.  We colour each point by the stellar
mass reached by the progenitor population prior to merging onto the
main branch. The median eccentricity of the high~$e$ group in the
Milky Way halo is indicated as a dashed horizontal line. To ensure
that we properly resolve the orbital properties of the stellar
component of the accreted satellites, we only show galaxies with
20 or more star particles, amounting to a total of 296 accreted
satellites.

There is a striking trend of median $e$ with $z_{\mathrm{merge}}$
in Figure \ref{fig:eagle}. The maximum median $e$ decreases with
lookback time, creating an upper envelope to the distribution of
data.  As a result, $z=0$ stellar particles resulting from the
earliest accretions typically have median $e\sim0.5$, whereas the
most recently accreted satellites occupy a large range of median
$e$ from $\sim 0.3$ up to $> 0.9$.  As we discuss below, this means
that early accreted satellites were accreted onto intermediate to
low $e$ orbits.  Most importantly, this result indicates that an
accreted satellite with stars at $z=0$ on very radial orbits is
unlikely to have been accreted earlier than $z\sim1.5$. We discuss
the implications of this finding for the formation of the Milky Way
thick disc, as suggested by \citet{2018arXiv180606038H}, in Section
\ref{finale}.

As expected from hierarchical clustering in a standard $\Lambda$-CDM
universe, it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:eagle} that, at the
highest redshifts, merged satellite galaxies are relatively low
mass.  Conversely, those that were accreted more recently are the
most massive. Almost all accretion of stellar systems with $M_*
\simgreater 10^9 M_\odot$ happened at $z \simless 1$.  This is
mainly due to the time taken for satellites to build up their stellar
mass. The fact that the satellite debris with the highest median
$e$ must have been accreted late also means that these satellites
are likely to be high mass. We find that the median mass of accreted
satellites with median $e>0.85$ is $4.1\times 10^{8}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$,
and a minimum mass of $0.77 \times 10^{8}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The
median accretion time of high $e$ debris is $z \sim 0.6$. This
suggests that the high~$e$ Milky Way halo population we identify
is likely to have had  $M_* \gtrsim 10^{8}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and
have been accreted after $z\sim 1.5$.  Accretion events such as
this are relatively rare in EAGLE, with only 5 of the 22 ($\sim~23\%$)
central galaxies having accreted any system with $10^8 < M_* < 10^9
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ after $z=1.5$ \emph{and} retaining a median $e > 0.8$ at $z=0$.  For
two of those five simulated galaxies, the aggregate of all accreted
stellar mass far exceeds that of the Galactic halo (e.g. by a factor of 2 or more), leaving only 3
galaxies ($\sim$~14\%) with accretion profiles resembling that
suggested by the observations reported in this paper.  It is also
worth noticing that the high~$e$ populations of the latter three
galaxies, although dominated by one massive accretion event, had
not insignificant contributions by accretions of smaller mass
systems.  The latter suggests that it is possible that the high~$e$
population of the Galactic halo may have contributions by low
mass systems as well.

Perhaps most importantly, the above discussion indicates that the
accretion event which deposited the high~$e$ Milky Way debris was
quite unusual for a galaxy of its $z=0$ virial mass.  If one further
considers that the Milky Way is currently accreting a similarly
massive galaxy (the Sagittarius Dwarf), our results suggest that
the overall accretion history of the Milky Way has been quite
atypical when compared to the rest of the galaxies of same halo
mass. This is an interesting result in light of the findings reported
by \citet{2018MNRAS.477.5072M}, that suggest the Milky Way, by its \afe{}-\feh{} abundance
pattern, may be an outlier in terms of accretion
history, for it's stellar mass. The Milky Way becomes even more
unusual in this sense, if one considers the very massive \emph{Kraken}
accretion event proposed by \citet{2018MNRAS.tmp.1537K}. We discuss
the implications of that work further in Section \ref{finale}.

\caption{\label{fig:echange} Median eccentricities at merger time
$e_{z_\mathrm{merge}}$ against median eccentricity at $z=0$ $e_{z=0}$
for satellites accreted onto Milky Way mass haloes in EAGLE. The
points are coloured by the stellar mass of the accreted galaxies
at the time of the merger, $M_*$. Debris which falls below the
dashed unity line has been circularised following accretion, whereas
the debris above this line has been radialised after accretion. The
majority of debris has a similar $e$ at $z=0$ to the time at which
it was accreted, but a few accreted satellites are circularised/radialised
following accretion. High mass satellite debris has undergone the
least change in median $e$.}
\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{fig:echange}, we show how the eccentricity of satellite
debris changes between the time of the merger and $z=0$. We measure
the initial eccentricity by taking the median eccentricity of the
star particles in the snapshot immediately following that in which
the satellite is identified as being merged onto the main progenitor.
It is clear from this figure that the orbit eccentricities are not
greatly changed following accretion. The median change in eccentricity
is small, at $\sim 4\%$, although a few accreted satellites have
changed their median eccentricity by as much as $\sim 20 \%$. It
is noticeable that the debris whose eccentricity has changed most
is that from lower mass satellites.  As noted previously, these are
the satellites commonly accreted earlier,
 although we find no significant trend between $z_\mathrm{merge}$
and the change in eccentricity, meaning that changes in the median
$e$ are not strongly time dependent.  By the same token, the highest
mass satellite debris are those which have undergone the least
change in median $e$, likely because they were accreted late, when
the gravitational potential of the host dark matter halo is no
longer varying significantly. Furthermore, no satellites accreted
at lower $e$ than $\sim 0.7$ have debris that is radialised to
higher than $e \sim 0.8$ by $z=0$. The finding that median $e$
changes very little is important, as it means that the trend between
$z_\mathrm{merge}$ and median $e$ at $z=0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:eagle})
is cosmological in nature, and not due to dynamical effects,
substantiating the idea that high orbit eccentricity is a good
indicator of late-time accretion.  The trend between $z_\mathrm{merge}$
and median $e$ is likely a product of the changing merger cross-section
with cosmic time, whereby the gravitational potential of the
central halo dictates the maximum impact parameter for a successful
accretion (as opposed to a ``fly-by'').  Galaxies in the
early universe are smaller and less massive, and so
approaching satellites must have a smaller impact parameter to be
accreted.  For instance, for a galaxy with $r_\mathrm{vir}
\sim 50$ kpc, $r_\mathrm{peri}$ must be $< 5.5$ kpc for $e > 0.8$,
whereas for $r_\mathrm{vir} \sim 250$ kpc, $r_{\mathrm{peri}}$ can
be as high as $\sim 28$ kpc for a similar orbit, assuming
$r_\mathrm{vir}$ determines the maximum $r_\mathrm{apo}$.  This
logic supports our contention that the high~$e$ group in the Milky
Way must have been a relatively late accretion event.


Regarding the low~$e$ group, the numerical simulations
reinforce the notion that it may be contributed by a combination
of smaller  and/or earlier accretion events. Given
that intermediate $e$ populations can be accreted at almost any
$z_{\mathrm{merge}}$ in EAGLE, and that the element abundances of
this group show no clear $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$ change of slope in the
\feh{} range observed and no clear MDF peak at moderately high
\feh{}, it is then most likely that these stars were accreted at
earlier times than the high~$e$ stars, and in small satellites. In
general, earlier and lower mass accreted satellites in the simulation
show $\alpha$-element enhancements, due to the fact that these must
have formed quickly (with high SFE) to be accreted at early times.  

\section{Summary and Conclusions} \label{finale}

This paper presents an analysis of chemical compositions and orbital
information of accreted halo populations, based on APOGEE and Gaia
data.  We applied k-means clustering to identify subgroups in
chemical composition and kinematics space, considering the abundances
of $\alpha$, odd-Z and Fe peak elements, and orbital eccentricity.
We have shown that $\sim~2/3$ of the accreted halo stars exhibit
very high orbital eccentricity and display chemical compositions
that are characteristic of those seen in massive dwarf galaxy
satellites of the Milky Way today, suggesting that this population
is likely the progeny of a single, massive accretion event which
occurred early in the history of the Milky Way Galaxy.  The remaining
1/3 of the sample consists of stars with low orbital eccentricities
and slightly higher abundance ratios than the high~$e$ population.
The latter stars likely result from a mixture of different origins,
including the remnants of less massive accretion events, {\it in
situ} star formation, disc heating, and likely some contamination
from the high $e$ population.

We further examine this scenario by studying a numerical simulation
from the EAGLE suite. We demonstrate that satellite galaxies accreted
into MW mass haloes show clear trends between the time of accretion
and the median eccentricity of the accreted stars at $z=0$. The
results from the simulations predict that debris with $e > 0.8$,
like that of the population identified in this paper and by other
groups
\citep[e.g.][]{2018MNRAS.475.1537M,2018arXiv180510288D,2018arXiv180606038H,2018MNRAS.478..611B}
is only realised at $z=0$ for satellites accreted after $z \sim
1.5$.  This constraint also means that such satellites are likely
to be accreted at  relatively high stellar mass ($M_*\gtrsim 10^{8}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We also showed that, according to the simulation,
the median eccentricity of accreted debris generally does not appear
to evolve significantly over time, further suggesting that a high
orbital eccentricity is a good indicator of a relatively recent
merger.  Analysis of the numerical simulations further suggests
that a massive accretion event such as that identified in the
APOGEE/Gaia data is not very common for a Milky Way-like galaxy,
suggesting an unusual accretion history in same vein as suggested
in previous work by e.g. \citet{2018MNRAS.477.5072M}.

Recently, various accretion events have been reported by different groups. The high~$e$ population identified in the combined APOGEE/Gaia
DR2 sample appears to be the same population as  those
discovered by \citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B}, \citet{2018arXiv180510288D} and
\citet{2018arXiv180606038H}.  We have shown that the kinematics of
the high~$e$ group is consistent with that found in these studies, having
very low, slightly negative $L_z$ consistent with the
\citet{2018arXiv180606038H} population, and $r_\mathrm{ap}$ as high
as 40 kpc, with a median of 15.1 kpc, and a suggestive secondary
peak at $r_\mathrm{ap} > 20$, in rough consistency with the
\citet{2018arXiv180510288D} population. Our high~$e$ population
has a median eccentricity in good agreement with those of
the populations discussed by \citet{2018MNRAS.478..611B} and the
clusters measured  by \citet{2018arXiv180500453M}.

\citet{2018MNRAS.tmp.1537K} suggest that the age-metallicity distribution of the Galactic globular cluster population can be used to infer the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way. They identify
one very massive ($M_* > 10^9\mathrm{M_\odot}$) accretion event
 (\emph{Kraken}), which is associated with the
overabundance of metal-rich GCs in the accreted cluster branch of
the age-metallicity relation and has no known debris. This is not
consistent with the accretion event identified in this paper, as it is both
too massive, and likely not associated with the accreted
GCs identified by \citet{2018arXiv180500453M}. \emph{Kraken} is more plausibly associated with GCs that reside inside 5 kpc from the Galactic center. It is more possible
then that the population reported in this paper \citep[and by
connection, likely also that of,
e.g.][]{2018MNRAS.478..611B,2018ApJ...852...49H,2018arXiv180606038H,2010A&A...511L..10N}
is associated with the less massive \emph{Canis Major} accretion
that was identified by \citet{2018MNRAS.tmp.1537K}. The clusters identified by
\citet{2018arXiv180500453M}, are
more easily linked with this event, which \citet{2018MNRAS.tmp.1537K}
argue is the progenitor of many of the GCs at Galactocentric radii $> 10$ kpc. In summary, all of these results point towards
confirmation that the assembly history of the Milky Way has been very active,
and quite atypical compared to other galaxies of a similar mass.

\citet{2018arXiv180606038H} suggest that their population,
\emph{Gaia-Enceladus}, is the debris from an accretion event that
caused the dynamical heating of the precursor to thick disc component
of the Milky Way, having been accreted approximately 10 Gyr ago.
The results from analysis of EAGLE suggest that if the debris at
$e \sim 0.85$ was accreted in a single satellite, then this may
have occurred around 8-9 Gyr ago (Figure~\ref{fig:eagle}).
The \citet{2018arXiv180606038H} merger time is based on the minimum
isochronal age of the stars in their sample so it is possibly indicative
of the final time of star formation rather than the actual accretion time.  On the other hand, EAGLE gives
the time at which the satellite became bound to the central halo,
so these timescales are potentially consistent.  Ages of stars in
the Milky Way high \afe{} disc population are generally found to
be older than or similar to $\sim 10$ Gyr
\citep[e.g.][]{2013A&A...560A.109H,2016MNRAS.456.3655M,2017arXiv170600018M},
so this does suggest that this population was in place before the
merger occurred. It is worth mentioning here, however, that analysis
of the origin of $\alpha$-enhanced populations in EAGLE suggest
that these stars must form in an early collapse in a period of rapid
gas accretion, in order to foster the high density ISM necessary
to generate a short enough gas consumption time to consume the high
\afe{} gas into stars before it is polluted by SN Ia \citep{2018MNRAS.477.5072M}, rather than forming in a
`primordial' disc which would then be heated. This scenario is
consistent with the `thick disc' being the result of the geometric
combination of the thick, centrally concentrated high \afe{} disc
and the extended, flared low \afe{} disc
\citep[e.g][]{2017arXiv170600018M,2016arXiv160901168M,2015ApJ...804L...9M}.
Further work on this newly found halo component, and the high \afe{}
disc, will surely shed more light on this discussion.

\section{Modelling \mgfe{} as a function of \feh{}}
\label{sec:appA}
In order to test whether a change in slope is found in the relationship
between \mgfe{} and \feh{} in the identified accreted halo groups,
we use a Bayesian inference to fit a piecewise-linear model to the
data. The form of the piecewise-linear function is given in
Equation~\ref{eq:pwlin}. We follow the general procedure outlined
in Section 7 of \citet{2010arXiv1008.4686H} for fitting models to
data with two-dimensional uncertainties. For completeness, we
re-iterate here the mathematics. The best fitting model is found
by maximising the likelihood function for the parameters $O =
[\mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0, \mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}_0, \theta_1, \theta_2]$ given
the data, which we assume here to be of the form
\begin{equation}
\ln{\mathcal{L}(O|\mathrm{[Fe/H]}, \mathrm{[Mg/Fe]})} = K -
\sum^{N}_{i=1}\left (\frac{\Delta_i^2}{2\Sigma^2_i} + \ln |\Sigma^{2}_i|\right)
\end{equation} 
where $\Delta_i^2$ defines the distance between the data-point $i$
and the model, and $\Sigma^2_i$ is the variance orthogonal to the
model, determined by the covariance matric of the data points. $K$
is a normalisation constant, which is not necessary to consider in
the optimisation. We assume uninformative flat priors on $\theta_{[1,2]}$,
and allow $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}_0$ and $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}_0$ to be free.
In this case, $\Delta_i^2$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:delta}
\Delta_i^2 = \hat{\bf{v}}^T \bf{Z}_i - \it{b} \cos\theta_{[1,2]}
\end{equation}
where $\bf{Z}_i$ is the column vector made by (\mgfe{},\feh{}$)_i$,
and $\hat{\bf{v}}$ is the unit vector orthogonal to the model:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\bf{v}} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+m_{[1,2]}^2}}\begin{bmatrix}-m_{[1,2]}\\1\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}-\sin\theta_{[1,2]}\\\cos\theta_{[1,2]} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{[1,2]}$, here and in Equation \eqref{eq:delta}, is
the angle between the linear model at that \feh{} and the x-axis,
which is equal to $\arctan{m_{[1,2]}}$. $\Sigma^2_i$ is then simply
defined as the projection of the data-point's covariance matrix
$\bf{S}_i$ orthogonal to the model at that \feh{}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma^2_i = \hat{\bf{v}}^T \bf{S}_i \hat{\bf{v}}.
\end{equation}
In this case, we assume that the uncertainties on \mgfe{} and \feh{}
are uncorrelated, such that
\begin{equation}
\bf{S}_i = \begin{bmatrix} \delta \mathrm{[Fe/H]}_i & 0 \\ 0 & \delta \mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}_i \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where we use the catalogue values for the uncertainties on \feh{}
and \mgfe{}. We minimise the negative log-likelihood using a downhill
simplex algorithm \citep{doi:10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308}, and use this
optimal solution to initiate an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling of the posterior PDF of the parameters O using an
affine-invariant ensemble MCMC sampler \citep{goodmanweare2010} as
implemented in the python package \texttt{emcee}
\citep{2013PASP..125..306F}. We report the median and standard
deviation of this posterior PDF as our best-fit parameters.
