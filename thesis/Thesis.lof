\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.10}{\ignorespaces Median eccentricities at merger time $e_{z_\mathrm {merge}}$ against median eccentricity at $z=0$ $e_{z=0}$ for satellites accreted onto Milky Way mass haloes in EAGLE. The points are coloured by the stellar mass of the accreted galaxies at the time of the merger, $M_*$. Debris which falls below the dashed unity line has been circularised following accretion, whereas the debris above this line has been radialised after accretion. The majority of debris has a similar $e$ at $z=0$ to the time at which it was accreted, but a few accreted satellites are circularised/radialised following accretion. High mass satellite debris has undergone the least change in median $e$.\relax }}{133}
